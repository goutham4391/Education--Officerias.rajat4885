										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UPSC IAS Prelims exam has evolved to become the most unpredictable one, among the three stages(Prelims-Mains-Interview). The extensive and diverse syllabus and the little amount of time to correct mistakes are the key causes. Contrary to the Mains, you only have two hours to demonstrate your ability to clear the Prelims. Aspirants <strong>MUST</strong> take into account the fact that there is unpredictability in the Prelims the moment they reach the test center. I will share the strategies for dealing with the uncertainties of the preliminary exams in two parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><u>Mental preparation for Prelims</u></strong> &#8211; More than everything else, you need to be vigilant, self-assured, and psychologically tough on the day of the Prelims exam. Be aware of the fact that the test will be unpredictable and that UPSC will ask a few bouncers. This acceptance of truth will calm your thoughts and enable clear thinking. The questions are intended to throw you off course and are meant to gauge your level of confidence. Don&#8217;t worry if you think that you are making mistakes. I can tell you with confidence that you will be able to answer the question once you have carefully read it. Focus on answering one question at a time, giving yourself just enough time to figure it out before moving on to the next. Do not forget that everyone will find the exam difficult if it is difficult for you. Keep your confidence up, and remember that your presence of mind is your best weapon in the Prelims exam.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might be tempted to answer all 100 questions at this point. Your mind will now set the next trap at this point. It would be beneficial if you made an effort in line with the circumstances and your comfort level. In the weekly exams that Officers&#8217; IAS Academy delivers to its students, we encourage them to answer as many questions as they feel comfortable with. While some students find that answering just 75 questions yields the best outcomes, others go as high as 100. From one to person, it differs. Our weekly exams are constructed as close to UPSC standards to provide the best IAS coaching experience, so that our students may reproduce them and successfully take the Prelims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong><u>Smart work in Prelims Preparation</u></strong>&#8211; Revisit your reference texts, attempt as many of the questions as you can, and study the UPSC <a href="https://officerspulse.com/previous-years-papers/">questions from the previous years</a>to improve your understanding. Make sure you are comprehensive with the fundamentals as well. If your fundamentals are solid, you can handle many of the prelims questions with ease. So emphasize studying the NCERT materials and you may take NCERT-related tests by clicking <a href="https://officerspulse.com/practice-ncert-tests/">here</a>. Concentrate on questions that have been asked frequently. Additionally, some topics are given a higher weighting than others. Therefore, be sure that you are proficient in these areas because your chances of passing increase the more knowledgeable you are in them. For instance, nearly one-fifth of the questions are related to the environment.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, themes with bigger weighting include Modern India, Economy, and Politics. Your chances of passing the Prelims increase as a result. To avoid being troubled by the sheer size of the static components, in the end, all of the static portions should be covered in the early stages of preparation. Additionally, if you are knowledgeable in static subjects, the doubt factor for Prelims decreases because you are more self-assured and capable of answering challenging questions in the Prelims test as a result of your extensive knowledge.</p>
<p>Make sure you&#8217;ve read the section on current events as many times as you can. It becomes crucial because so many of the Prelims questions are based on current events. Since current affairs are so diverse, you should only read one current affairs publication, like <a href="https://officerspulse.com/monthly-pulse-at-a-glance/">PULSE</a>, and keep reading it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OPAZr218_U">Click here</a> to watch the video of our student Sivanandham(AIR-87), who used ONLY <a href="https://officerspulse.com/">Officers’ Pulse</a> to achieve this feat in his very first attempt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prelims is the stage with the most ambiguity, and it was intentionally made that way to test the candidate&#8217;s mental agility. Once you leave the exam room and look at the question paper once again, you will find that the questions are rather straightforward and can be answered with knowledge and &#8220;presence of mind.&#8221; You are making mistakes because of your stress. With this in mind, we developed a detailed study program that brings the <a href="https://officersiasacademy.com/batches/">best IAS coaching methods</a> and has made our academy one of the top IAS coaching institutes in India. I implore every aspirant to make use of the information and tools I have provided. I wish everyone well on their upcoming exams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Circadian rhythms control the cycles of alertness and concentration in our bodies. Our 24-hour sleep/wake cycle is formed by them, and it is this cycle that determines when we are hungry, how tired we are, and even when we engage in activities like work and study. So when is the optimum time to study for each individual depending on a variety of lifestyle conditions? Since everyone is unique, there isn&#8217;t a clear-cut &#8220;optimal&#8221; time to study for the UPSC IAS exam. As the top IAS Academy in Chennai that has produced many splendid civil servants, Officers IAS Academy suggests you find your own study time, after reading this article carefully.</p>
<p>Even though everyone&#8217;s circadian rhythms are distinctive, some patterns show that people do in fact fall into the &#8220;early bird&#8221; or &#8220;night owl&#8221; categories. Those who are typically early risers may discover that they are ready to go as early as 5am.</p>
<p>The &#8220;night owl&#8221; is typically the exact opposite. Up until midday, when they experience their first rush of energy, they will remain lethargic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>The advantages of daytime studying</u></strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple to make the case that studying throughout the day is a wise move. You&#8217;ll feel revived and alert, which will help you remember things better, as your circadian rhythms will be in operation. And you are less likely to need indoor lights throughout the day. In fact, sunlight is healthy for your eyes. It offers the precise spectrum of light needed to preserve good vision, and it cooperates with the pituitary gland to awaken and alert you. Most sleep physicians advise exposing oneself to as little artificial light at night as possible, including TV, computer, and smartphone screens, since indoor illumination has been demonstrated to disrupt the sleep cycle. Because of this, certain gadgets now have &#8220;blue light filters&#8221; that regulate how much blue light is seen on the screen. As opposed to artificial light, natural light can aid in concentration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ideas for daytime learning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A nutritious breakfast can help you focus better.</li>
<li>Find a study location (indoor or outside).</li>
<li>Remove any potential distractions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>The advantages of night-time study</u></strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry about whether you feel most productive at night or if that&#8217;s when you have time to study. The benefits of studying during the day are numerous, and there are a variety of reasons why some people find that studying at night is preferable. The solitude and quiet you enjoy when studying at night are a benefit. People tend to be calm and reflective at night. Some people may find that setting to be just what they need to get in the appropriate frame of mind for studying. Many people feel that at night, with the stresses of the day behind them, their minds are free to consider additional options. People typically feel more creative at night. Your everyday responsibilities are finished, allowing you to focus on your work. And doing so can be helpful when writing assessments or engaging in creative endeavors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ideas for night-time learning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Limit potential distractions by switching your phone to mute and turning off the TV.</li>
<li>Caffeine should be avoided since it might take the body up to four hours to process it. It could offer you an energy boost, but it might also keep you from getting good sleep.</li>
<li>Establish a schedule that still leaves you with adequate time for a restful night&#8217;s sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>So what could be the best time to study?</u></strong></p>
<p>Everything relies on your way of living. Younger individuals who engage in more nighttime activity as part of their routine will discover that studying at night comes more readily to them. If you&#8217;re an adult returning to study after a long break, you could discover that the daytime is more convenient for your established schedule. But ensure that you are getting adequate sleep. Nothing is preventing you from beginning your studies, regardless of whether you prefer the morning or the evening. Time Management is the key here and to learn more, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ADtKVq9qHM">click</a> to watch the video of Mr. Rangarajan IAS.

I wish you the best in finding your study cycle and for the upcoming exams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A major modification to the online application procedure for the numerous exams the UPSC administers has been made with the introduction of the &#8220;One Time Registration&#8221; (OTR) service. This action is anticipated to simplify the application procedure for the tens of thousands of candidates who sit for several examinations each year, including the UPSC Civil Services/ IAS exam. The &#8220;One Time Registration&#8221; (OTR) platform has been made available on the UPSC’s websites on a round-the-clock basis.</p>
<p>Candidates must register on the OTR platform by providing the requested basic personal information if they intend to take UPSC exams in the future. After an aspirant has completed the registration process, the information will be safely kept on the servers of the UPSC. The &#8220;One Time Registration&#8221; (OTR) service has been launched to make it easier for candidates for its Examinations to submit their applications. It was developed by the UPSC to streamline online applications and cut down on the time it takes for applicants to apply online. Aspiring UPSC applicants may utilize this feature to save their personal information and other pertinent information on the websites, and the portal will keep them for future usage.</p>
<p>Up until recently, applicants who were taking several tests had to provide their personal information each time they applied online through the UPSC&#8217;s official website. Candidates may now keep their personal information and retrieve it while applying for multiple tests thanks to this mechanism. Through this service, around 70% of the information will now be automatically filled in. This not only saves applicants time but also lessens the possibility of mistakes while submitting applications online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to register?</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: Open the website upsconline.nic.in</p>
<p>Step 2: Click on &#8220;<a href="https://upsconline.nic.in/upsc/OTRP/index.php">ONE TIME REGISTRATION (OTR) FOR UPSC EXAMS</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>Step 3: Students must provide their basic information, including Name, Father&#8217;s and Mother&#8217;s Names, Phone Numbers, Email Addresses, etc.</p>
<p>Step 4: Verify Your OTR Profile Information &amp; Complete Registration.</p>
<p>Step 5: The applicant will receive an OTP on his registered email and cellphone number, which he/she must input.</p>
<p>Step 6: After completing the registration procedure, the candidate will see their OTR ID on the screen. The OTR profile may now be printed off or screenshot by the candidate.</p>
<p>Step 7: The applicant must now log in. To do so, the candidate must input his mobile number, email address, or OTR ID in addition to the OTP that will be sent to his/her registered email and cellphone.</p>
<p>Step 8: Modify the OTR ID password for UPSC.</p>
<p>Step 9: The UPSC OTR registration procedure for the applicant is now complete. The candidate may now apply from any new applications that are released and can also access the history of previous applications from those same applications. Download and save a copy of the OTR form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What could be the benefits?</strong></p>
<p>The OTR will be very helpful for the candidates as it will not only prevent them from having to fill out their basic personal information again for any subsequent UPSC examinations, but it will also eliminate any chance that they will submit inaccurate information because their basic personal information will be verified by the candidates themselves. Information about a candidate will be filled up automatically in the online application form for the examination they are applying for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I request every aspirant to make use of this service, especially if you are planning to appear for various exams conducted by the UPSC. Kindly go through the FAQ by clicking <a href="https://upsconline.nic.in/upsc/OTRP/candidate/faq.php">here</a>, in case you have further doubts.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my perspective, the Mains exam is a marathon of writing. For 27 hours and nine papers, one must remain cognitively alert while also ensuring that each answer they write contains certain components that will give them the maximum marks they can get. Keep in mind that even the toppers receives only around half of the maximum marks. Therefore, the goal for each aspirant should be to compose an answer that includes all pertinent information as well as some qualitative elements. The writing tips listed below will help you ace your Mains exam and earn the well deserved Interview call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>1) Previous Year Papers:</u></strong> Make sure to go through all the <a href="https://officerspulse.com/previous-years-papers/">previously asked questions</a>. Reading over these papers enables you to comprehend the crucial parts and concentrate your efforts on those specific areas for better marks. By doing so, you get well versed in those areas that are consistently asked.</p>
<p><strong><u>2) Usage of keywords:</u></strong> The Mains test is a race against time and space. You are given a limited amount of time and space to write your answer. Thus, each word you write is important. The keywords you use matter more than anything else. If you could describe ideas in fewer words, as opposed to using unnecessary words, you would have more room to write and, at the same time, would impress the examiner by demonstrating that you are ahead of others. For instance, you can assert that &#8220;constitutionalism is a must”, instead of saying that &#8220;one must resist tyranny, including the worst outcome of majority rule, to ensure the liberty and rights of individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><u>3) Complete all of the questions:</u></strong> This can sound like an easy notion, but it is challenging to complete all of the questions throughout the exam. Your position on the final list might be affected by as little as one mark. As a result, whether you are familiar with the answer or not, make sure you are able to attempt every question. Additionally, make sure you practice answer writing before the exam so you know the pace at which you can comfortably complete the exam.</p>
<p><strong><u>4) Writing according to the nature of the paper:</u></strong> Remember that each paper has a certain nature. For example, GS 1 covers history, social concerns, and other topics; GS 2 covers politics; GS 3 covers economics, among other topics. Therefore, it is preferable to produce a GS3 answer from an economics perspective and a GS2 paper from a political one.</p>
<p><strong><u>5) Handwriting:</u></strong> Although one cannot instantaneously modify their handwriting, one that is difficult to read might indeed be detrimental to the scores. To aid you in drafting your answers, get practice at writing legibly and coherently.</p>
<p><strong><u>6) Properly structuring the answering:</u></strong> When responding to questions, always use the &#8220;Introduction-Body-Conclusion&#8221; approach. This guarantees that the response has both a structure and beauty while answering. The body of the answer you write gives the impression that you are knowledgeable about the specifics of the problem, and the conclusion can also be a &#8220;way forward&#8221; and allow you to present recommendations and creative solutions to the problem. The introduction enables the examiner to understand that you have understood the scope of the question. All of these tiny details contribute to raising your score.</p>
<p><strong><u>7) Supportive arguments:</u></strong> To demonstrate that you have not given a random statement, whatever arguments you give must be backed up by extra pertinent points. Examples, statistics, and facts from reliable sources (government, international organizations, etc.) are required as supporting evidence.</p>
<p><strong><u>8) Figures:</u></strong> The rationale is straightforward; they save space and gives the response a professional appearance. Figures are similar to information that is confined to a certain space. You may sometimes show that you are aware of the solution and ensure that you have room to express any further points by utilizing a specific figure. Even flowcharts and diagrams may be used to save time, especially when you&#8217;re short on time.</p>
<p><strong><u>9) Dividing the answer into sections:</u></strong> Instead of writing the entire response in one long paragraph, utilize subheadings that are pertinent to the topic and highlight the crucial phrases as you write. This enables the examiner to recognize the key details and demonstrates that you have addressed all the sub-questions in the question by providing sub-headings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For passing the Civil Services exam, nothing may be more gratifying than perseverance, hard work, and a fundamental grasp of subjects. Additionally, if you use these strategies, your marks will undoubtedly increase. If you need step-by-step guidance for clearing the Mains exam, <a href="https://officersiasacademy.com/mains-test-series-2022/">click here to</a> <a href="https://officersiasacademy.com/mains-test-series-2022/">join our Mains Program</a> to receive the best IAS coaching experience, both offline and online. I wish you the very best for your upcoming Mains exam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have decided to prepare for the UPSC Civil Services Exam, I must emphasize the importance of perseverance, dedication, and hard work. As the IAS exam expects you to cover a vast syllabus and as the stages of the exam are objective, subjective, and a Personal Interview respectively, one has to put in a certain amount of time to see your name on the final list. Ideally speaking, an aspirant has to put in an average of 6-8 hours every day. For those who are working, especially in the IT sector, success can be achieved with minor tweaks to the preparation pattern. I will explain the tips that you should incorporate into your IAS preparation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><u>Tailor-made timetable-</u></strong> As you are working, the need for a timetable cannot be stressed enough. I must explicitly mention that you should not blindly follow someone else’s timetable. Start studying once you are ready, and slowly form the timetable that suits your needs as well as time constraints. If you are working, make sure to utilize every spare minute you have to cover your syllabus. For example, you may use your time wisely while you commute, eat, etc. Try to cover the current affairs while you get such time as a good current affairs compilation, like <a href="https://officerspulse.com/monthly-pulse-at-a-glance/">Officers’ Pulse</a>, is designed in such a way that information can be easily grasped in a short period.</li>
<li><strong><u>Studying the syllabus-</u></strong> Going through the <a href="https://officerspulse.com/syllabus/">syllabus</a> is not enough, but you must understand and comprehend the prelims/mains syllabus. This would help you understand the nature of the exam as well as help you avoid studying unwanted portions.</li>
<li><strong><u>Previous Years Question Papers-</u></strong><a href="https://officerspulse.com/previous-years-papers/">Go through them</a> to fully comprehend how questions are asked by the UPSC and accordingly make any change in your preparation.</li>
<li><strong><u>Covering the syllabus-</u></strong> Since there is a paucity of time in your preparation, covering the syllabus would improve your score in the exam and for this, an online course would typically suit your needs. For example, you may <a href="https://officersiasacademy.com/online-foundation-programs/">join Officers IAS Academy’s Online Foundation Course</a>, which is designed for students who have time constraints but require the best IAS coaching experience. They are streamed live and you may participate in the live question and answer session that follows each lecture. They also provide recordings for students who were unable to attend class. Weekly examinations will be held online, with results and a full analysis of test performance supplied so that students may focus on their particular strengths and shortcomings. Students who choose the online foundation course get all of the benefits of the classroom curriculum plus the convenience of scheduling and repetition.</li>
<li><strong><u>Making the required sacrifice-</u></strong> Every minute matters and you are expected to devote them to your preparation completely. Kindly refrain from using social media and unwanted social gatherings like parties.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many examples of aspirants who cracked the IAS exam while working. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPVTxxQnN6c">Click here</a> to go through the video by Mittali Sethi IAS, a student of Officers IAS Academy who cracked this exam while working. Mr. Rangarajan IAS who is a Faculty in Officers IAS Academy who is a Chartered Accountant &amp; Cost Accountant also cleared UPSC CSE while working for Private Bank. Watch his video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ADtKVq9qHM">clicking here</a>, where he talks about how he managed time.</p>
<p>What matters the most, as I have said before, is the commitment toward your goal and fighting for it.</p>
<p>I wish you the best in your preparation and I look forward to seeing the future civil servants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Civil Services Exam, more commonly called the IAS exam, is designed as a combination of Subject Knowledge, as well as Current Affairs. To be successful in this exam, you have to ensure that the two, i.e., Subject Knowledge and Current Affairs are put forth in such a way that it fulfills the need of the answer. Typically, the Subject Knowledge areas are called “static areas”, as they can be learned from reference textbooks. Current affairs are generally considered the recent events that have happened in the last 2-3 years that are important for the UPSC IAS exam. I will explain how both of these have to be studied in the following points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>How to prepare for General Knowledge</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Follow standard textbooks such as the NCERTs to acquire a solid understanding of the subject. Make sure that you are grasping and revising the topics that you have read, instead of rote learning.</li>
<li>Allot time for each of the subjects in a manner that you do not leave out any important subjects.</li>
<li>Test your knowledge by taking mock tests and accessing <a href="https://officerspulse.com/previous-years-papers/">previous years’ questions</a>. This would improve your understanding of the exam, as well as expose the areas where you have to focus on.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>How to prepare for Current Affairs</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Current Affairs, as the name suggests, is drawn from recent events and you can access it from major newspapers, preferable The Hindu. You are required to obtain information related to the IAS exam from the newspaper and refrain from reading any unwanted news. Kindly go through the <a href="https://officerspulse.com/syllabus/">syllabus</a> and Previous Years’ Papers for a better understanding of the topics that are asked in the exam and accordingly look for related topics in the newspapers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1One16tMJA&amp;list=PLRBNc1mXxwYc3GyI2vS2vFU7i1KDHVx54&amp;index=2">Click here</a> to understand how and what to read in the Hindu newspaper.</li>
<li>Compliment your reading with other sources like All India Radio, RajyaSabha TV, The PIB, The Indian Express, etc. to supplement your knowledge.</li>
<li>If you need a one-stop solution for current affairs, you may go through a good current affairs compilation, like <a href="https://officerspulse.com/">Officers’ Pulse</a>, where all the major sources are compiled in such a way that your prelims and mains related information is segregated and presented accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OPAZr218_U">Click here</a> to watch the video of our student Sivanandham(AIR-87),  who used ONLY <a href="https://officerspulse.com/">Officers’ Pulse</a> to achieve this feat in his very first attempt.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For both General Studies and Current Affairs, one has to study according to the syllabus along with a meticulous study plan. If you feel that you need guidance in your civil services preparation, you may <a href="https://officersiasacademy.com/batches/">join our online/offline classes</a> for the best IAS coaching experience. Our classes are planned in such a way that the syllabus is completed and tests are regularly conducted to ensure the best experience. As the only UPSC coaching academy started by a group of like-minded former Civil Servants, our pedagogy is designed and delivered by experts who have not only cleared all stages of the UPSC examination and have gone on to serve this nation with great distinction. Our coaching method has produced many civil servants and if you wish to see the video of two such aspirants who got IAS and IPS in their very first attempt, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXMwWJLz_08">click here</a>. I wish you the best in your preparation and I look forward to seeing the future civil servants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Mains exam, which is conducted over five days and has a total of 27 writing hours<br />
(language papers included), is more like a test match than the prelims exam, which can be completed in just 2+2 (GS + CSAT) hours. You must be emotionally and physically competent enough to appear for Mains. In comparison, the Prelims exam is over in a matter of hours, and regardless of your marks, once you reach the cut-off in the GS/CSAT paper, you will automatically clear the Prelims. But for the Mains exam, you should not only get the minimum score for each paper but also make sure that you outperform others in the competition. I will go into detail on how to prepare for each of these papers, and for further doubt clarifications, I request you to contact Officers’ IAS Academy or visit our Chennai/Bangalore branch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>GS1-Paper-II</u></strong></p>
<p>Many of the topics covered here are static subjects, such as geography, history, and art &amp; culture. Therefore, it takes several iterations to fully grasp the fundamental concept. Instead of reading various books, make numerous revisions of the basic text. To understand the type of questions and prepare appropriately, confer with the <a href="https://officerspulse.com/mains-previous-years-papers/">questions from the previous years</a>. Indian society is the dynamic topic here, for which you need to put additional efforts. You must thus thoroughly understand Indian society, including its values, problems, vulnerable groups, etc. In this area, while you are supposed to be sympathetic, try to add evidence, reports, and recommendations to make the answer seem more convincing and considerate. At the same time, it shouldn&#8217;t appear artificial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>GS2- Paper-III</u></strong></p>
<p>The majority of the GS2 topics would be covered in your prelims preparation alone, therefore further sessions are not required. The only thing you need to keep in mind is that, while answering questions, attempt to write like a Polity student by emphasizing the constitutional viewpoint, government initiatives, and their repercussions, and placing an economic perspective in the background. Use statistics and charts to help you explain the solutions while using keywords like major constitutional articles and committee recommendations in your answer.</p>
<p>When studying international relations, it&#8217;s important to consider how certain events influence India, why they happened, and what actions India may take.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>GS3- Paper-IV</u></strong></p>
<p>Try to approach this from an economic viewpoint as it mostly consists of Economics and related topics. Keep this your first level of thought, and combine it with government schemes, facts, and solutions, properly format your response to communicate your ideas.<br />
You must understand the underlying problem for the other topics, such as science and technology, security, disaster management, etc. before you can write about it in the test. To begin developing material, go to the <a href="https://officerspulse.com/mains-previous-years-papers/">questions from the previous year</a>s and gain an understanding of their nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>GS4- Paper-V</u></strong></p>
<p>The Ethics paper (GS4) would be the simplest of all the GS papers. Please refrain from copying anything verbatim from the textbooks, into your answer sheets. Because you are expected to express what you feel, the words and ideas you use must come from you. The theory section and the case studies section each make up the GS4 paper. Give several examples and quotations to support your assertion, and tie it to a theory where necessary. All of them must come after you&#8217;ve told the examiner what&#8217;s on your mind. The UPSC is more interested in knowing your position than the thinkers. All of you <a href="https://youtu.be/nhVnGdfBfPI">can see the video</a> of class taken by Mr.Sivanandham AIR &#8211;  87 &amp; Dr.Madhan AIR – 195 who were students of Officers IAS Academy and cleared this exam in 2022</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Essay- Paper-I</u></strong></p>
<p>Please keep in mind that you are writing an essay, not a GS answer. You are not required to illustrate answers with bullet points. Well-crafted thinking that is beautifully crafted with words is a good essay. The perfect essay should be well-written and have sufficient substance that one may employ to make an elegant yet simple point. After reading the essay, the topic should be so straightforward that even the average person can grasp it. To receive the best marks, your essay must have adequate paragraph unity, coherence, cohesion, and structure. All of you <a href="https://youtu.be/fGIID3dIaFw">can see the video</a> of Mr. Rangarajan ( Former IAS ) Faculty at Officers IAS Academy and also attend a live session of a “SPECIALIST” whose video will not be shared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Optional Paper</u></strong></p>
<p>Only the universal aspects of optional preparation may be discussed because every Optional is unique. First, review <a href="https://officerspulse.com/previous-years-optional-papers/">the papers from prior years</a> and adjust your preparation. Try to respond to the question&#8217;s demand that aligns with your Optional, rather than a GS-style approach. Link subjects from Paper 1 to Paper 2 and vice versa wherever you can. To make the content richer, use illustrations and examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understanding the Mains curriculum is more important than simply preparing for all of these GS topics. Since a detailed curriculum has been provided by the UPSC, I kindly ask that you go through the whole Mains test syllabus to become familiar with it. To view the entire Mains test syllabus, <a href="https://officerspulse.com/syllabus-2/">click here</a>. Combine this with your analysis of the exam, to comprehend how questions are posed. More importantly, join the best IAS academy for practicing mock UPSC level questions to get your IAS dreams to come true. <a href="https://officersiasacademy.com/mains-test-series-2022/">Click here</a> to join Officers IAS Academy’s Mains test series program as we offer the best IAS coaching experience. Before I conclude, remember; that Mains is a test match; gain momentum gradually and steadily. I welcome you all into our Mains program and wish you the very best for your Mains exam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While you prepare for the IAS exam, it is advised to use the Prelims cum Mains approach, which is strictly followed at Officers IAS Academy. This would enable the aspirants to gradually cover the vast syllabus for both stages. However, aspirants occasionally tend to put off their mains preparation, which puts them in a difficult position once they clear prelims. I will attempt to clarify what an aspirant should do in such a difficult circumstance.</p>
<p><strong><u>How to approach the Mains exam, if you are short on time?</u></strong></p>
<p>The first thing that has to be done is to have a look at <a href="https://officerspulse.com/mains-previous-years-papers/">the previous year&#8217;s question papers</a>. You should learn the areas from where very few questions are asked in addition to being able to comprehend how the questions are asked. For instance, in GS-1, only one question from World history is often asked for the Mains exam. This doesn&#8217;t imply that you should not study World History at all; rather you should prioritize other areas over it. Identify the subjects and areas that generate the most questions for the actual Mains.</p>
<p>Once you do the above-mentioned analysis, start your answer writing sessions and simultaneously prepare the necessary content for each topic. Also, go through the Previous Year’s Questions once again to make yourself familiar with the nature of the questions asked. For instance, you may anticipate quite a few questions from the GS-1 “Indian Society” topic each year, and the content that is related to it is easily available. Continue in this manner for all the other subjects, by making sure that you assign them time and effort, in the correct order of significance. Try to assign the least significant topics the barest amount of time and preparation. Likewise, follow these instructions for your optional paper. Keep aside adequate time for your optional preparation and provide enough time to analyze the papers from the previous year and develop an appropriate approach.</p>
<p><strong><u>Focusing on subjects that takes less time</u></strong></p>
<p>In general, the syllabus is quite vast for General Studies (GS), particularly GS1, GS2, and GS3. In contrast, GS4 (Ethics) may be completed quickly because the syllabus is relatively simple and short.  Ethics is certainly a scoring paper, even though there is very little overlap with the other papers. You can use this as an opportunity to make up for the possible lost marks from other GS papers. Additionally, try to allocate the deserved time for the Essay paper.<br />
A good essay may be written using the skills you&#8217;ve developed during your UPSC preparation, and like the Ethics paper, it will get you the additional marks that you need for the Interview Call. However, write the essay with content, clarity, coherence, and substance for the essay to receive the maximum marks. Although it could be challenging for you to create a strong essay on your first effort, you will see significant changes once you put your best effort.</p>
<p><strong><u>How to effectively use the common topics?</u></strong></p>
<p>An advantage that you can instantly take is the overlapping topics of Prelims and Mains. For instance, the Polity of the prelims and GS2 overlap. The topics of the environment, science &amp; technology in GS3 and Prelims are also similar. As a result, you have a solid foundation in these areas. These subjects now need to be supplemented a little to make them content-rich for mains. For example, strengthen the Polity you studied for the prelims by learning about many crucial judgments and the analytical side of key government schemes. This would significantly improve the quality of your answers in a short amount of time because you have previously covered the fundamentals (during your prelims preparation) and what you need to do now is sharpen the knowledge that you possess already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although reading through the aforementioned advice will help you increase your marks for the Mains exam, you should maintain a continuous answer writing approach. Your chances of getting the Interview Call will be affected if you are unable to complete all of the questions in the allotted three hours. While taking practice tests for Mains, you will also learn the tips and tricks of improving the score. The crucial thing to focus right now is to pick up that pen and keep writing until you feel competent, regardless of whether you began late for your Mains preparation. You may <a href="https://officersiasacademy.com/mains-test-series-2022/">join our Mains Answer Writing Program</a> that hand holds you through the preparation process to get your Interview Call. Continue writing with us so that you receive the best IAS coaching from our Gurus who themselves cleared the Civil Services exam. Before I conclude, I wish to assure you that our team at Officers’ IAS Academy understands your concerns, and we will be with you every step of the way. I wish you the best for the upcoming Mains exam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations on making a bold decision to appear for the civil services exam. You are now going to acquire knowledge that spans multiple subjects and at the end of the process, I assure you, you will be a learned person. The UPSC Civil Services Examination syllabus is an overall compilation of General Studies which include Polity, Economics, Geography, History, etc. If you have lesser means to appear for offline classes, then you have two options to proceed with: 1) Either start a self-study with a solid timetable, or 2) Join an online class by the best IAS Academy that support you every step of the way. I will explain both the options briefly so that you may choose accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to do self-preparation, then you have to ensure that your basics are rock solid. For this, cover the NCERTs and then proceed to any reference textbooks. As the UPSC prefers conceptual clarity over rote learning, ensure that you go through the NCERTs in a way that you understand the underlying information. Supplement this with reference textbooks for each subject along with practice tests( prelims and mains) till you are confident enough. Make sure that the tests you take are qualitative as the questions have to be on par with the UPSC standard. While doing all of the above, stick to the syllabus to ensure that you don&#8217;t get overburdened with the knowledge that you have to assimilate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Online Foundation Course is designed for working professionals and college students with other responsibilities who want to pass the UPSC/IAS Exam from the convenience of their own homes. If you wish to take an online course, then there are a few advantages that you have. Not only does an online course can guide you every step of the way which can save your time, especially if you are working, but it will also ensure that everything that is needed can be found in one place. Some of the advantages of the <a href="https://officersiasacademy.com/online-foundation-programs/">Online Foundation Course</a> offered at Officers’ IAS Academy are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experienced faculties who have cleared the UPSC/IAS exam</li>
<li>Chance for live participation in the doubt clearing session held after each lecture.</li>
<li>Recordings to students who may have missed the class due to emergencies.</li>
<li>Weekly tests that are held online and test results with detailed analysis of the test performance</li>
<li>Robust online infrastructure and technical expertise along with a student portal.</li>
<li>Dedicated current affairs magazines that are prelims cum mains oriented.</li>
<li>Mentoring program</li>
<li>Materials needed for the UPSC/IAS exam, which will be sent by courier</li>
<li>Complete coverage through the syllabus through the Prelims cum Mains approach</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The students opting for the online foundation course receive all the benefits of the classroom program with the bonus of convenient timing and repetitive learning. As you can view the lectures multiple times, you can go back and review what you learned. This can increase your grasp of the subject matter. <a href="https://onlineofficersiasacademy.com/course/sample-videos/">Click here</a> to watch the sample videos of our classes for a better understanding.</p>

<p>Be it self-study or online classes; kindly remember that you are going to appear for one of the most prestigious exams in the country. This exam demands perseverance and dedication from your end to win this game, which is achievable through constant revision and conceptual understanding. Once you start the journey to become a civil servant, then let go of your ego and make use of every bit of the opportunity to better yourself.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The India Year Book is an annual book published by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting&#8217;s Publication Division, which includes reports from all of the government&#8217;s departments. It&#8217;s a detailed overview of the country&#8217;s development in numerous areas. As a result, the India Year Book is a valuable resource for UPSC candidates. But, the book itself is bulky as it contains extensive information regarding various ministries and the country itself. Here, a cover-to-cover reading method should not be followed. Instead, selective reading based on important areas is to be focused to get the best outcome.<br />
Instead of reading it chapter-wise, it is better to approach it subject-wise, as an aspirant can save time as well as avoid repetition. Further to this, try to cover the most important chapters, and then if the time permits, one can go for the others. There are 32 chapters in total, dedicated to various topics. I will explain what the important ones are so that you can prioritize them. Please keep in mind that the information that is given in the India Year Book will be synonymous with what you have already learned in your reference books and current affairs magazines. Hence, try to use the India Year Book as a supplementary cum revision source, and not as a separate source of information itself. Try to cover it as fast as possible while assimilating new information from the book while skimming through those that you have already covered in your reference texts. Make use of the following two tips to intelligently use the Year Book for your prelims.</p>
<ol>
<li>In order to finish the book, go through the following chapters that are the most important ones- Chapter 1(Land and the People), 2(National Symbols), 3(Polity), 4(Agriculture), 5(Culture and Tourism), 6(Basic Economic Data), 9(Defence), 10(Education), 11(Energy), 12(Environment), 16(Health and Family Welfare), 18(India and the World), 23(Planning), 24(Rural and Urban Development), 25(Scientific and Technological Developments), 28(Welfare), 29(Youth Affairs and Sports), 30 (States and Union Territories).</li>
<li>You only need to remember the rough statistics, not all of the facts and data. That should be enough to solve the India Year Book-based questions in the UPSC prelims. The objective and prospects of the schemes/acts/bills/committees etc. must be remembered. Only the facts and figures relating to budget allocation are important and any other data and figures can be avoided. Only the chapters on the environment, geography, science and technology, energy, military, international affairs, and industry are to be prioritized for the Prelims. After the Prelims, you may read the rest of the topics that are synonymous with the mains syllabus</li>
</ol>
<p>As the uncertainty in the prelims continues, leave no stones unturned and be ready to face any surprise UPSC throws at you. As you can see from Previous Year’s Questions, the prelims can be tackled with a solid basic in understanding the core topics. Hence, use the India Year Book to consolidate and cement your preparation by filling out the holes in your preparation. I wish you the very best in the upcoming Prelims exam.</p>
